# Notes
### Issues
* Number of people who have finished a particular challenge; we don't want this
to be in the ChallengeTemplate because then we'd have to update the Template too
often. Where else could we put it?
### Ideas
* Display somewhere how many challenges the User has finished in how many cities
(e.g. "You have finished 5 challenges in 3 cities"); maybe include a map
highlighting the countries.
* Referrals (e.g. discounts when you finish a challenge)
